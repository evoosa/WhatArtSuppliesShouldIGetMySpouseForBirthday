# I Need Art Supplies, Help!

**TL;DR**
Once a month I get a phone call from a friend asking me what art supplies he should get for his GF for her birthday,
so I build a website with a short survey you can fill
to get a list of potential art supplies you can buy for your creative loved ones.

**feel free to contact me for more recommendations, or just to chat, or to report bugs :)**

So you woke up early in the morning to go to the gym, feeling fine and fresh,
when suddenly you get a horrifying popup message from Google Calendar...

## Your partner's birthday is in a week! ðŸ˜± and you didn't get her a present!!! ðŸ˜ 

#### Oh no s.he's going to be so sad! what have you done, how could you forget? ðŸ˜”

you got out of bed quickly, sweating and in panic,
while running in circles around your room, you tried to remember what your partner showed interest in lately.

**"Hey, s.he told me that s.he wants to learn how to draw! OMG!**

**"I'll call Eva she'll know for sure what art supplies I should get her! ðŸ˜€"**

### so you called Eva:
_**ring ring..**_

*(it's 5 AM BTW because you like getting up early in the morning for some reason)*

_**ring ring..**_

**Eva**: "Hey Bro, what's u..."

**You**: "EVA OMG LISTEN, my GF has a birthday in a week, and I want to buy her art supplies, what should I get her?
ðŸ˜­ help me I'm in crisis!"

**Eva**: "[it's 5 AM go to sleep](https://i-need-art-supplies-help.pasten.life/)"

*Eva hangs up the phone*

Enjoy <3
